## Introduction

limetube is a simple user interface for downloading with [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/).

It is written in Python 3, and I have only confirmed it runs on **windows**.

## Features
* Download **audio** or **video** with just a link and a single click.
* Keep track of downloads with automatic logging of downloaded videos (default log location is  Documents folder).
* Change color scheme of application.

## Install Instructions
* Download pre-packaged exe folder at the [releases page](https://github.com/ZG34/limetube-public/releases).
* Source Code on [GitHub](https://github.com/ZG34/limetube-public)
* If packaging exe yourself with pyinstaller, make sure to drag "assets" into the final folder containing the .exe file.
